•Apply for your HCSA licence in HALP ([https://halp.moh.gov.sg](https://halp.moh.gov.sg/)).

•Each licence has a licence tenure of two years.

•Renew your HCSA licence at least two months before expiry to avoid late fee charges.

•Inspections will be de-linked from licence renewals for all LHS.

•Inspection frequency will be risk-based, i.e., a good history of compliance may mean less frequent inspections

•Inspections may occur after renewal instead of during or before renewal

•Payment of licence application or renewal fee may be made via GIRO or Credit Card.
