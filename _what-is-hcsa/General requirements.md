Over the past two years, MOH engaged extensively with various stakeholders and noted several areas of enhancements for the regulatory framework.  
On 6 March 2023, Parliament approved the amendments to HCSA Â to ensure patients benefit from the delivery of healthcare services by licensees under a robust regulatory regime, and from greater clarity and transparency in healthcare services advertising and modes of service delivery.  
The HCSA Amendments (2023) will introduce specified services and non-premises based modes of service delivery (e.g. virtual medical consultations, home medical care) for various licensable healthcare services. From June 2023, licensees will be required to seek approval for the modes of service delivery (MOSDs) and specified services (SSes) provided.
