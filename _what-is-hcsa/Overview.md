New care models for patients have emerged, and healthcare services are increasingly delivered through different modes, such as conveyance, mobile and online channels. This necessitates a shift towards a more flexible approach in the regulation of Singaporeâ€™s healthcare system. Under the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act (PHMCA) and regulations, healthcare providers are licensed based on different types of premises (e.g., medical clinic, nursing home, hospital, clinical & x-ray laboratory) while under HCSA, healthcare providers will be licensed based on the healthcare services provided.

HCSA better safeguards patient safety and well-being in the changing healthcare environment, while enabling the development of new and innovative healthcare services. It also strengthens governance and regulatory clarity for better provision and continuity of care to patients
