New care models for patients have emerged, and healthcare services are increasingly delivered through different modes, such as conveyance, mobile and online channels. This necessitates a shift towards a more flexible approach in the regulation of Singapore’s healthcare system. Under the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act (PHMCA) and regulations, healthcare providers are licensed based on different types of premises (e.g., medical clinic, nursing home, hospital, clinical & x-ray laboratory) while under HCSA, healthcare providers will be licensed based on the healthcare services provided.

HCSA better safeguards patient safety and well-being in the changing healthcare environment, while enabling the development of new and innovative healthcare services. It also strengthens governance and regulatory clarity for better provision and continuity of care to patients


# KEY CHANGES FROM PHMCA TO HCSA

**Broadened Regulatory Scope**
Under HCSA, the regulatory scope will be broadened to potentially include a wider scope of healthcare services, allied health services, nursing services, traditional medicine, and complementary and alternative medicine (**Figure 1**). Services that do not provide direct patient care, such as Beauty and wellness services, _are not included_ in the scope of HCSA, as such services do not involve the assessment, diagnosis, prevention, alleviation or treatment of a medical condition or disorder.

MOH will adopt a risk-based regulatory approach in determining which services are licensable under HCSA. While allied health services, nursing services, traditional medicine and complementary and alternative medicine are potentially within the scope of HCSA, MOH _will not_ be licensing these services for the moment. The practice of professionals such as physiotherapists and Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners will continue to be regulated through the existing Professional Acts.
