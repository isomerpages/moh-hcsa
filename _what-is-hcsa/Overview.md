New care models for patients have emerged, and healthcare services are increasingly delivered through different modes, such as conveyance, mobile and online channels. This necessitates a shift towards a more flexible approach in the regulation of Singapore’s healthcare system. Under the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act (PHMCA) and regulations, healthcare providers are licensed based on different types of premises (e.g., medical clinic, nursing home, hospital, clinical & x-ray laboratory) while under HCSA, healthcare providers will be licensed based on the healthcare services provided.

HCSA better safeguards patient safety and well-being in the changing healthcare environment, while enabling the development of new and innovative healthcare services. It also strengthens governance and regulatory clarity for better provision and continuity of care to patients


# KEY CHANGES FROM PHMCA TO HCSA

**Broadened Regulatory Scope**
Under HCSA, the regulatory scope will be broadened to potentially include a wider scope of healthcare services, allied health services, nursing services, traditional medicine, and complementary and alternative medicine (**Figure 1**). Services that do not provide direct patient care, such as Beauty and wellness services, _are not included_ in the scope of HCSA, as such services do not involve the assessment, diagnosis, prevention, alleviation or treatment of a medical condition or disorder.

MOH will adopt a risk-based regulatory approach in determining which services are licensable under HCSA. While allied health services, nursing services, traditional medicine and complementary and alternative medicine are potentially within the scope of HCSA, MOH _will not_ be licensing these services for the moment. The practice of professionals such as physiotherapists and Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners will continue to be regulated through the existing Professional Acts.

**Licensing Approach and Implementation**

I.     Licensable Healthcare Services under HCSA  
  
Under HCSA, healthcare providers will need to apply for approval to hold licences for the **licensable healthcare services (LHS)** they provide, as well as the appropriate **modes of service delivery (MOSD)** applicable for the LHS. This is a change from the PHMCA where providers are licensed based only on physical premises.  
  
The introduction of **Specified Services (SSes)** for each LHS is another change from PHMCA to HCSA. Licensees will also need approval from the Ministry of Health prior to offering these SSes. SSes generally involve complex or higher risk procedures provided in a LHS and have distinct requirements for patient safety. The approval regime for SSes builds on the approval process that was in place for special care services in medical clinics, and specialised procedures and services in private hospitals set out under the PHMC regulations.  
II.   Modes of Service Delivery  

To cater for new and emerging models of care that are no-longer premises based (e.g. home care, telemedicine), there will also be **4 modes of service delivery (MOSDs)** under HCSA. MOH will define the allowable MOSDs for each LHS. Licensees **must seek MOH’s approval for the MOSDs** used to deliver each LHS.

III.   Specifed Services Under HCSA

Under HCSA, there are SSes for each LHS. SSes generally involve complex or higher risk procedures provided in a LHS and have distinct requirements for patient safety. SSes include some of the specialized procedures and special care services in the Second and Third Schedules of the PHMC Regulations (e.g. radiation oncology, endoscopy), sub-disciplines of service within a LHS (e.g. different laboratory disciplines and tests, radiation technology applied) and newly identified procedures or services (e.g. collaborative prescribing, liposuction, dental cone beam computed tomography).  
  
With the introduction of HCSA, the specialised procedures and services under the Second and Third Schedule of the PHMC regulations were reviewed; and these procedures and services were either transited to a LHS (e.g. assisted reproduction), a SS (e.g. radiation oncology), or no longer classified as a service requiring approval under HCSA (e.g. organ transplant). The specialised procedures and services under the Second and Third Schedule of the PHMC regulations which are no longer classified as a service requiring approval under HCSA are reflected in **Table 1** below. Nonetheless, licensees will be required to comply with licence conditions relevant to the licensable services they provide, and these will be separately issued to the licensees.
